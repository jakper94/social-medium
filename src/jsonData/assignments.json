            "description": "In this assignment, you will work alone and use OAuth2 to build a simple web application that allows users to login through, for example, GitHub, Facebook, or Google. After login, the website should display some information about the user that you retrieve from the authentication provider. For users who have logged in before, you should also display when the user logged in last. This means that you will need to store users together with timestamps in some sort of data store. To make you website work with OAuth2, you need to register it at the provider you have chosen (we recommend GitHub). When you register the application, you need to enter a name for the application and its URL. In our case, since we will not publish this application, the URL will be something like http(s)://localhost:XXXX where XXXX is the port. Further, you need to enter a callback URL, for example http(s)://localhost:XXXX/callback. After registering the application, you will get a client ID and a client secret to access the authentication provider. You should keep both client ID and secret hidden from the user, only you and your application should know it."

            "description": "You will work in groups of four and design a social medium based on the results of a market analysis conducted by marketing students at ECU Perth. The analysis identifies gaps and potentials for improvement in social media systems in education. Your are going to pick at least one of those gaps, turn them into an idea for a social medium, and implement it in an interactive Lo-Fi prototype. You will continue to work with your idea after this assignment until the end of the course. The students at ECU will provide feedback on your Lo-Fi prototype. This feedback should help you refine your idea and you should address that feedback later when you implement a Hi-Fi prototype in assignment 3.To implement your prototype, you can use programs such as Pop, Adobe XD, or Sketch. You should also analyse what target group your medium has and what benefits it will bring to them. You can present the results of your analysis, for example, using the Honeycomb model or with a business model canvas. Your analysis should address social, economic, market-relevant, and content-related aspects of your design."
